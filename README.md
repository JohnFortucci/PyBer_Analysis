## Summary

Based on the dataframe and the graph above , and using the characteristics identified , we can identify a minimum of three business recommendations.

### Recommendations

#### 1) Reduce the number of drivers in Urban cities

The ratio of the drivers to number suggest an imbalance against total number of rides (1625) and Toatl Drivers (2405) , therefore the recommendation would be to reduce the number of drivers in urban areas.

#### 2) Increase the number of drivers in Rural cities

Rural city type has the highest average fares per ride ($34.62) and the highest average fares per driver ($55.49) , this suggest that this is a prifitable city type and that the recommendation would be that we increase the number of drivers in Rural areas to try and increase the total rides in that area.

#### 3) Increase focus on Suburban city types

Suburban city types have a good average fare for both the average fare per ride ($30.97) and the average fare per driver ($39.50) , this suggest that the suburban area fares are lucrative for both the company and driver. Therefore our recommendation would be that we target an increase number of rides in this city type , this might be to increase PyBer awareness via adevertising in these city types.
